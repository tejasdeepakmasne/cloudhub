# General Outline

This page is for taking note of various programs used to build the application as well as how to use them.

## rclone 

### what is rclone?
Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. It is a feature-rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage interfaces. Over 40 cloud storage products support rclone including S3 object stores, business & consumer file storage services, as well as standard transfer protocols.

Rclone has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands rsync, cp, mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat. Rclone's familiar syntax includes shell pipeline support, and --dry-run protection. It is used at the command line, in scripts or via its API.

### How rclone will be used :
rclone will be used for various operations involving adding, managing and removing cloud storages. It will also be used for syncing.

## what to use for GUI??
GTK, QT or electron can be used, most likely will use electron as it will be benefitial later on for other stuff.
electron is also much easier to build UIs with, the main thing is backend which will most likely use nodejs or python.

## Steps to take :
0. Map out what will constitute your MVP 
1. Learn rclone and find out the useful commands  
2. Plan out basic frontend and make it
3. Make basic backend with only google drive
